Ethernaut asks us to withdraw as many tokens as possible.
For this exploitation, the only method that accepts user-input directly or indirectly is transfer().

The intention is to withdraw a value bigger than one's original balance. Since the balances mapping maps addresses to uints and _value is an uint as well, we can conclude that
any negative value placed will actually represent an overflown positive integer. If balances[addressX] becomes - 3; the contract will actually display the value 2^256 -3.

For that reason, the _value passed at the transfer function should be equal to a user's balance minus one.
