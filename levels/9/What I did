Level instance creation transaction: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x09c5f09fb79b528c7eee1cd7fcacbe8c9b1bd6cd92db876768a5ec7045364ce2
Level instance submission transaction: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x176d707120d8a0de338bd98451813df62dc3bc78e360b30cda1d63ce7baca10f
The submission transaction has reverted execution on some of the internal transactions due to the fact that the Attack Smart Contract
reverts at any fallback. Hence, it has got a warning to it, still the console has logged the level as complete.

Upon reading the task, what came into focus was the following line: "avoid such a self proclamation".

That directed my focus to an attack that could represent any sort of Denial of Service or could make transactions revert in any sort of way.
(Hardcoded revert(), impossible require() method calls and fallbacks with a too big gas expenditure.)
